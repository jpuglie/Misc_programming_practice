The purpose of this project was to teach myself how to use OCaml more effeciently,
as well as attempt to develop a very basic Hopfield Recurrent Neural Network.

Files-
sde2.caml: All of the expressions developed for the project
sde2.log: Demonstrates usage of each expression

Bugs- Notice that the final two expressions hopTrainAState and hopTrain are blank. This is because this was an undergraduate project,
and when I wrote these expressions they ended up causing errors so I left only the expressions that worked as intended. These last two
expressions are what truly tie together the neural network to actually train the program to learn the matrices, I grasp the theory behind how to complete this but I was unable to get the program working in this language in time.
